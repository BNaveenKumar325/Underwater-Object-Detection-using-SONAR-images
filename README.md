As the requirement for efficient underwater surveil lance and search operations has increased, so too has the necessity for dependable object detecting systems [6]. In low visibility situations, traditional approaches frequently fail, necessitating the use of sophisticated detecting techniques [5]. Three state-of the-art deep learning techniques—CenterNet [5], YOLO [12], and Faster R-CNN [4]—are used in this study to improve underwater item detection accuracy, particularly in difficult conditions. Even in low light, the objective is to correctly identify a variety of things on the water surface, including people, ships, and air planes [9][12]. Comprehensive testing shows that, in comparison to current techniques, our method greatly increases detection accuracy and robustness [6][13]. The outcomes demonstrate our models’ practical applications in marine safety and efficiency by demonstrating how well they address the challenges presented by underwater settings [7][17]. This study makes a significant contribution. Paper foucs on first step towards considering data from different sensors in environment, to develop detection performance in crtical conditions also [8]. When optical imaging is mixed with data from sonar and radar, the model is improved in areas of block processing and small object detection [18]. This also shows benfit in making the proposed system a practical tool to meet the increasing challenge for providing safety and operational efficiency in different underwater scenarios along with the capability of real-time realization of the tool in marine operations
